While some homeowners can DIY this repair, improper fixes can lead to water waste and higher bills. We provide fast, affordable toilet repairs with guaranteed results."},{question:"Why is my faucet dripping?",answer:"Dripping faucets are typically caused by worn washers, O-rings, or valve seats. Even a slow drip can waste thousands of gallons annually. We can quickly diagnose and repair faucet leaks, or recommend replacement if the fixture is old or extensively worn."},{question:"How much water can I save with a low-flow toilet?",answer:"Modern WaterSense certified toilets use just 1.28 gallons per flush compared to older toilets that use 3.5-7 gallons. For a family of four, this can save up to 16,000 gallons of water per year and reduce water bills by $110 or more annually."},{question:"Can you match my existing fixtures?",answer:"We work with all major fixture manufacturers and can help you find matches for existing fixtures or suggest coordinating alternatives. Bring us photos or model numbers and we'll find the perfect fit for your home."},{question:"How long does toilet or faucet installation take?",answer:"Most toilet installations take 1-2 hours, and faucet installations take 1-2 hours depending on the fixture and existing plumbing.
