Lifespan depends on water quality, maintenance, and usage patterns.\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"Should I choose a tank or tankless water heater?\",\n        answer: \"Tank water heaters cost less upfront and provide large volumes of hot water. Tankless heaters save energy, last longer, and provide endless hot water but have higher upfront costs. We'll help you choose based on your needs, budget, and usage.\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"How often should I maintain my water heater?\",\n        answer: \"We recommend annual maintenance for all water heaters.

Video inspection can identify the root cause for permanent solutions.\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"Are chemical drain cleaners safe to use?\",\n        answer: \"We don't recommend chemical drain cleaners. They can damage pipes, especially older ones, and are harmful to the environment. They often provide only temporary relief. Professional drain cleaning is safer and more effective.\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"What's the difference between snaking and hydro jetting?\",\n        answer: \"Snaking uses a cable to punch through clogs, providing quick relief. Hydro jetting uses high-pressure water to completely clean pipe walls, removing all buildup. Hydro jetting is more thorough and provides longer-lasting results.\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"Can tree roots damage my sewer line?\",\n        answer: \"Yes, tree roots seek water and can penetrate sewer lines through tiny cracks or joints. Once inside, they grow and can completely block the line. We can clear roots with hydro jetting and recommend solutions to prevent recurrence.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    category: \"Leaks & Repairs\",\n    faqs: [\n      {\n        question: \"How do I know if I have a hidden water leak?\",\n        answer: \"Signs include unexplained water bill increases, water meter running when no water is being used, damp spots on floors/walls/ceilings, musty odors, or the sound of running water when fixtures are off. We offer leak detection services to locate hidden leaks.\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"Should I repair or replace a leaking faucet?\",\n        answer: \"For faucets less than 10 years old, repair is usually cost-effective. For older faucets or when repair costs exceed 50% of replacement, we recommend replacement with a new, more efficient model.\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"What causes pipes to burst?\",\n        answer: \"Common causes include freezing temperatures, corrosion, excessive water pressure, physical damage, and age. Regular maintenance, proper insulation, and pressure regulation can prevent most burst pipes.\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"Does homeowners insurance cover plumbing leaks?\",\n        answer: \"Most policies cover sudden, accidental damage from burst pipes but may not cover gradual leaks or poor maintenance.

Our certified technicians ensure safe, code-compliant installations.\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"Do you work with both natural gas and propane?\",\n        answer: \"Yes, we service both natural gas and propane (LP) systems.
