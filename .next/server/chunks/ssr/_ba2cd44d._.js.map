Pressure above 80 PSI can damage fixtures and pipes and should be reduced with a pressure regulator.\"\n        },\n        {\n          question: \"Why is my water pressure suddenly low?\",\n          answer: \"Sudden low pressure can indicate a leak, a closed shutoff valve, a failed pressure regulator, mineral buildup in pipes, or municipal water supply issues.

High pressure causes faster water flow and more water use. A regulator also extends fixture life and prevents costly leaks.\"\n        },\n        {\n          question: \"How much does pressure regulator installation cost?\",\n          answer: \"Pressure regulator installation typically costs $300-600 including the valve and labor.
