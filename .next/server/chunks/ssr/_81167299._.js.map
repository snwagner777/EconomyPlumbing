An undersized heater leaves you with cold showers; an oversized one wastes energy and money.\n\n**Tank Water Heater Sizing (First Hour Rating Method):**\nCalculate your peak hour demand by identifying your busiest hot water hour (typically morning). Add up gallons used: shower (10-20 gallons), shaving (2 gallons), washing hands/face (2 gallons), dishwasher (14 gallons), washing machine (32 gallons). Match your peak demand to the heater's First Hour Rating (FHR), not just tank capacity.\n\nGeneral guidelines: 1-2 people need 30-40 gallons (FHR 40-50), 2-3 people need 40-50 gallons (FHR 50-70), 3-4 people need 50-60 gallons (FHR 70-90), 5+ people need 60-80 gallons (FHR 90-120+). Families with teenagers, multiple bathrooms, or simultaneous usage need higher capacity.\n\n**Tankless Water Heater Sizing (Flow Rate Method):**\nCalculate required flow rate (GPM - gallons per minute) by adding simultaneous uses: shower (2.5 GPM), bathroom sink (0.5 GPM), kitchen sink (1.5 GPM), dishwasher (1.5 GPM), washing machine (2.0 GPM). For example, simultaneous shower + kitchen sink = 4 GPM minimum.\n\nThen factor in temperature rise: subtract incoming groundwater temperature from desired output temperature. Central Texas groundwater averages 65-70°F. For 120°F output, you need 50-55°F temperature rise. Higher rises require more powerful units or lower flow rates.\n\nGeneral guidelines: Small homes (1-2 bath) need 5-7 GPM, Medium homes (2-3 bath) need 7-9 GPM, Large homes (3-4+ bath) need 9-11+ GPM or multiple units. Consider whole-house systems for main needs plus point-of-use units for remote fixtures.\n\n**Professional Assessment:**\nOur technicians perform detailed assessments considering household size, peak usage patterns, simultaneous usage, fixture types, existing plumbing, and future needs. We don't just follow formulas—we analyze your actual hot water habits to recommend the perfect size. Proper sizing saves money upfront and long-term through optimal efficiency.\n\n**Cost vs Value Analysis:**\nWhile it's tempting to oversize \"just in case,\" oversized tank heaters waste energy maintaining extra hot water you don't use. Oversized tankless heaters cost more without benefit. Right-sizing balances capacity, efficiency, and cost for the best value.`\n      }}\n      signsTitle=\"Key Factors to Consider Before Buying\"\n      signs={[\n        {\n          title: \"Fuel Type Availability\",\n          description: \"Your home's existing utilities determine options.

Solutions: Annual professional flushing ($100-$200), more frequent anode rod replacement (every 2-3 years vs. 5 years), descaling tankless heaters annually ($150-$250), whole-home water softener installation ($800-$2,500 upfront, $5-$15/month salt), and choosing models designed for hard water. Softeners are single best investment for appliance longevity in our area—they extend water heater life 3-5 years and pay for themselves through reduced maintenance and energy savings.\"\n        },\n        {\n          question: \"What's the difference between recovery rate and capacity?\",\n          answer: \"Capacity is how much hot water the tank holds (30-80 gallons). Recovery rate is how quickly it reheats after use (gallons per hour). A 50-gallon tank doesn't provide 50 gallons of hot water continuously—it provides its capacity plus what it can reheat during use. First Hour Rating (FHR) combines both: how much hot water delivered in first hour of peak use. Example: 50-gallon gas heater with 40 GPH recovery has FHR of 70 gallons (50 stored + 20 reheated in first hour). Two 50-gallon heaters can have vastly different FHR—always check FHR, not just capacity. Gas heaters have faster recovery (35-50 GPH) than electric (12-23 GPH). This is why you should size based on FHR matching peak demand, not just tank size matching family size.\"\n        },\n        {\n          question: \"Should I repair or replace my aging water heater?\",\n          answer: \"Replace if: unit is 10+ years old, repairs exceed 50% of replacement cost, tank is leaking, major component failure (heat exchanger, tank, gas valve), frequent repairs (2+ in past year), rising energy bills (efficiency declining), or you're planning home sale (old heaters are red flags). Repair if: unit under 8 years old, simple fix (thermostat, heating element, pressure relief valve), single isolated issue, repair under $300-$400, and you're budget-limited. Gray area (8-10 years, $400-$600 repair): consider efficiency of new models, remaining warranty, and total cost of ownership. We provide honest assessments with repair vs. replace comparison including costs, expected remaining life, and recommendations. We don't push unnecessary replacements—but we won't bandaid a failing unit either.\"\n        }\n      ]}\n      relatedServices={[\n        { title: \"Water Heater Services\", path: \"/water-heater-services\" },\n        { title: \"Water Pressure Solutions\", path: \"/water-pressure-solutions\" },\n        { title: \"Gas Line Services\", path: \"/gas-line-services\" },\n        { title: \"Emergency Plumbing\", path: \"/emergency-plumbing\" }\n      ]}\n      blogCategory=\"Water Heaters\"\n    />\n  );\n}\n","import src from \"IMAGE\";\nexport default { src, width: 400, height: 218, blurWidth: 8, blurHeight: 4, blurDataURL: \"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRtMAAABXRUJQVlA4TMcAAAAvB8AAAM1VICICHggACQAAAADzANgebHgbDBgAAAAAAAAwAAAAAAAAAAwAA4axAQh4GAYePAAAAIAHAnACAQAAcP7dSjYgDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgPCPUtd5IMAmAAAAAOc/s16QAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEHw0xeZSjs0fijNjYoCmJe8zzo3PgenqLH3HjUJ/MQaymPPOCgD0tdLCcEf+6efqXfZ75t1pSBAAA==\"};\n"],"names":[],"mappings":"wCAaM,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,AAAW,CAAX,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,OAAW,OAAA,EAAiB,UAAY,CAAA,CAAA,AAC5C,CAAC,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAQ,CAAA,CAAE,AAAF,EAAK,CAAU,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,AAAK,QAAA,CAAU,CAAA,CAAA,AACvC,CAAC,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAQ,CAAA,CAAE,AAAF,EAAK,CAAW,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,AAAK,QAAA,CAAU,CAAA,CAAA,AACxC,CAAC,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAQ,CAAA,AAAE,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,AAAO,KAAM,CAAQ,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,AAAM,CAAG,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,AAAK,EAAG,CAAK,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,AAAI,CAAK,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,AAAK,QAAA,CAAU,CAAA,CAAA,AAC9E,CAAC,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAQ,CAAA,CAAA,AAAE,EAAG,CAAY,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,AAAK,QAAA,CAAU,CAAA,CAC1C,CAAA,CAAA,wDCLK,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,AAAO,CAAP,WAAO,OAAA,EAAiB,MAAQ,CAAA,CAAA,AACpC,CAAA,AACE,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,AACA,CAAA,AACE,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CACE,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,AACF,CAAA,CAAA,CAAK,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CAAA,AACP,CAAA,CACF,CACD,CAAA,CAAA,kKCrBD,EAAA,EAAA,CAAA,CAAA,cCAe,CAAE,IADjB,AACiB,EADjB,CAAA,CAAA,QACiB,OAAG,CAAE,MAAO,IAAK,OAAQ,IAAK,UAAW,EAAG,WAAY,EAAG,YAAa,iUAAiU,EDG3Y,SAAS,IACtB,MACE,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,EAAA,OAAW,CAAA,CACV,MAAM,8DACN,gBAAgB,6JAChB,UAAU,sDACV,UAAW,EACX,aAAa,gEACb,UAAU,4BACV,aAAa,gDACb,cAAc,wCACd,oBAAoB,8ZACpB,SAAU,CACR,8CACA,uCACA,kCACA,sCACA,mCACA,oCACA,4BACA,2CACA,kCACA,kCACA,4CACA,iCACD,CACD,cAAc,0CACd,SAAU,CACR,CACE,MAAO,iCACP,YAAa,ybACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,qCACP,YAAa,gfACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,mCACP,YAAa,gfACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,sBACP,YAAa,6fACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,+BACP,YAAa,8cACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,2BACP,YAAa,qbACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,6BACP,YAAa,oaACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,sBACP,YAAa,+cACf,EACD,CACD,kBAAmB,CACjB,MAAO,0CACP,QAAS,CAAC;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;6PAkB2O,CAAC,AACxP,EACA,WAAW,wCACX,MAAO,CACL,CACE,MAAO,yBACP,YAAa,+OACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,gCACP,YAAa,yNACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,uBACP,YAAa,sOACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,2BACP,YAAa,mOACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,6BACP,YAAa,2OACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,iCACP,YAAa,2NACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,+BACP,YAAa,+NACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,0BACP,YAAa,4NACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,uBACP,YAAa,+NACf,EACD,CACD,iBAAiB,0CACjB,gBAAiB,CACf,CACE,MAAO,kCACP,YAAa,oPACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,qCACP,YAAa,8OACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,wBACP,YAAa,2OACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,8BACP,YAAa,kPACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,2BACP,YAAa,qOACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,8BACP,YAAa,+NACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,4BACP,YAAa,uPACf,EACA,CACE,MAAO,0BACP,YAAa,uNACf,EACD,CACD,KAAM,CACJ,CACE,SAAU,iDACV,OAAQ,whBACV,EACA,CACE,SAAU,2CACV,OAAQ,urBACV,EACA,CACE,SAAU,4DACV,OAAQ,yoBACV,EACA,CACE,SAAU,4DACV,OAAQ,gtBACV,EACA,CACE,SAAU,kDACV,OAAQ,4tBACV,EACA,CACE,SAAU,sCACV,OAAQ,uuBACV,EACA,CACE,SAAU,mDACV,OAAQ,iwBACV,EACA,CACE,SAAU,qDACV,OAAQ,w6BACV,EACA,CACE,SAAU,yDACV,OAAQ,0yBACV,EACA,CACE,SAAU,6DACV,OAAQ,6zBACV,EACA,CACE,SAAU,4DACV,OAAQ,muBACV,EACA,CACE,SAAU,oDACV,OAAQ,iyBACV,EACD,CACD,gBAAiB,CACf,CAAE,MAAO,wBAAyB,KAAM,wBAAyB,EACjE,CAAE,MAAO,2BAA4B,KAAM,2BAA4B,EACvE,CAAE,MAAO,oBAAqB,KAAM,oBAAqB,EACzD,CAAE,MAAO,qBAAsB,KAAM,qBAAsB,EAC5D,CACD,aAAa,iBAGnB","ignoreList":[0,1]}
