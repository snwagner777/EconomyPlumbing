Each type has unique advantages depending on your household needs, budget, and energy efficiency goals.\n\nTraditional Tank Water Heaters store and heat 30-80 gallons of water continuously. They're the most affordable upfront option and provide reliable hot water for most households. Available in electric, natural gas, and propane models. Best for: Families with predictable hot water usage, budget-conscious homeowners, and homes without space constraints.\n\nTankless Water Heaters heat water on-demand as it flows through the unit, providing endless hot water. They're 24-34% more energy efficient for homes using less than 41 gallons daily, and up to 14% more efficient for homes using around 86 gallons daily. While more expensive initially, they save money over time through reduced energy costs and longer lifespan (20+ years vs. 10-12 years). Best for: Energy-conscious homeowners, homes with limited space, and families tired of running out of hot water.\n\nHybrid/Heat Pump Water Heaters use electricity to move heat from the air to the water instead of generating heat directly. They're 2-3 times more energy efficient than traditional electric water heaters but require adequate space and ambient air. Best for: Environmentally conscious homeowners in moderate climates with available space.\n\nHigh-Efficiency Tank Models offer improved insulation and more efficient heating elements or burners, providing a middle ground between traditional and tankless options. They cost less than tankless but offer better efficiency than standard tanks. Best for: Homeowners wanting improved efficiency without the higher cost of tankless.\n\nOur experienced technicians will assess your home's hot water demands, available space, fuel sources, and budget to recommend the best solution. We'll calculate your household's peak usage, consider future needs, and explain the total cost of ownership including installation, operating costs, and expected lifespan.`\n      }}\n      maintenanceTitle=\"Water Heater Maintenance Tips\"\n      maintenanceTips={[\n        {\n          title: \"Flush Your Tank Annually\",\n          description: \"Sediment buildup reduces efficiency and shortens lifespan.

Traditional tanks are less expensive initially ($1,200-$2,500) but have higher operating costs and limited capacity. Consider tankless if you: have multiple bathrooms, frequently run out of hot water, want to save on energy bills long-term, or have limited space.

Areas with very hard water may benefit from flushing twice yearly. Sediment reduces efficiency, causes noise, and shortens tank life. Signs you need flushing include rumbling noises, reduced hot water capacity, and longer heating times. Our maintenance service includes professional flushing, anode rod inspection, and complete system check.\"\n        },\n        {\n          question: \"What's the most energy-efficient water heater option?\",\n          answer: \"For maximum efficiency, tankless water heaters are typically the best choice, offering 24-34% better energy efficiency than traditional tanks. They only heat water when needed, eliminating standby heat loss. Heat pump (hybrid) water heaters are also highly efficient, using 60% less energy than standard electric models. For traditional tanks, high-efficiency models with improved insulation and Energy Star certification offer good performance.

Expansion tanks prevent excessive pressure buildup that can damage your water heater, plumbing fixtures, and appliances. They're especially important with tankless water heaters. Signs you need an expansion tank include relief valve dripping, pipe joints leaking, and reduced water heater lifespan. Installation typically costs $200-$400 and is included in most new water heater installations.\"\n        },\n        {\n          question: \"Can you repair my water heater or does it need replacement?\",\n          answer: \"This depends on the issue, age, and overall condition. We generally recommend repair if: the unit is less than 8 years old, repair costs less than 50% of replacement, and it's an isolated issue like a failed thermostat or heating element. Consider replacement if: the unit is over 10 years old, has extensive corrosion, requires frequent repairs, or repair costs exceed 50% of new installation. We provide honest assessments and explain all options with pros, cons, and costs so you can make an informed decision.\"\n        },\n        {\n          question: \"What causes my hot water to smell like rotten eggs?\",\n          answer: \"Rotten egg smell in hot water is caused by sulfate-reducing bacteria reacting with the magnesium anode rod in your water heater, producing hydrogen sulfide gas. This is more common with well water or in areas with high sulfate content. Solutions include: increasing water heater temperature to 140°F temporarily to kill bacteria, replacing the magnesium anode rod with an aluminum-zinc alloy rod, flushing and disinfecting the tank with hydrogen peroxide, or installing a powered anode rod. We'll diagnose the cause and recommend the most effective solution.\"\n        },\n        {\n          question: \"Do you offer warranties on water heater installations?\",\n          answer: \"Yes! All our water heater installations include both manufacturer warranties and our workmanship guarantee.
