The pump should turn on, discharge water, and shut off automatically. If it doesn't, call us for service."},{question:"How long do sump pumps last?",answer:"Quality sump pumps typically last 7-10 years. Pumps that run frequently or are in harsh environments may need replacement sooner. Regular maintenance extends pump life and ensures reliability."},{question:"Do I need a battery backup sump pump?",answer:"Battery backup systems are highly recommended, especially in areas prone to power outages. Many heavy rains that cause flooding also knock out power. A backup system provides protection when you need it most."},{question:"What's the difference between a sump pump and sewage pump?",answer:"Sump pumps handle clear groundwater from foundations and basements.
