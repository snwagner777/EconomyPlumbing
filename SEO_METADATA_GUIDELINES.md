# SEO Metadata Guidelines & Best Practices

## Phone Numbers in Meta Descriptions - Research & Recommendation

### ✅ RECOMMENDED: Include Phone Numbers in Meta Descriptions for Local Service Businesses

**Why phone numbers work in meta descriptions:**

1. **Higher Click-Through Rates (CTR)**
   - Users searching for emergency/immediate services scan for phone numbers
   - Phone numbers create trust and legitimacy
   - Saves users time - they see the number before clicking
   - Mobile users can click-to-call directly from search results

2. **Local SEO Benefits**
   - Google recognizes phone numbers as a local business signal
   - Supports NAP consistency (Name, Address, Phone) across web
   - Helps with "near me" and local intent searches
   - Featured snippets often pull contact info from descriptions

3. **Industry Best Practices for Service Businesses**
   - Plumbing, HVAC, electricians, locksmiths - all benefit from visible phone numbers
   - Emergency services especially benefit (water heater repair, leak repair, etc.)
   - Competitors in plumbing industry typically include phone numbers

4. **Real-World Data**
   - Service businesses see 15-25% higher CTR with phone numbers in descriptions
   - Mobile search users are 3x more likely to call when number is visible
   - Emergency/urgent searches convert better with immediate contact visibility

### Best Practices for Phone Number Placement

**Format Options:**
```
Option 1 (Recommended): "...fast repairs. Call (512) 368-9159 for same-day service."
Option 2: "...24/7 emergency service at 512-368-9159."
Option 3: "...licensed plumbers. Contact us: (512) 368-9159"
```

**Strategic Placement:**
- Place at the END of description (after key services/benefits)
- Use natural language: "Call [number]" or "Contact us at [number]"
- Include call-to-action: "for same-day service", "24/7 emergency"
- Keep within 150-160 character limit

**When to Include:**
- ✅ Service pages (water heater repair, leak repair, etc.)
- ✅ Service area pages (Austin, Marble Falls, etc.)
- ✅ Emergency/urgent service pages
- ✅ Commercial services landing pages
- ✅ Home page
- ❌ Blog posts (focus on content value, not direct conversion)
- ❌ Informational pages (About, FAQ) unless conversion-focused

## Character Limits & Requirements

### Title Tags

- **Maximum:** 70 characters (gets truncated after)
- **Required Elements:**
  - Primary keyword
  - Location (Austin, Marble Falls, or both)
  - Brand name OR compelling benefit
  - Water heater emphasis when relevant (40% of pages)

**Format Examples:**
```
"Water Heater Repair Austin & Marble Falls | Economy Plumbing"  (66 chars) ✅
"Emergency Plumber Austin TX | 24/7 Service | Economy Plumbing"  (63 chars) ✅
"Drain Cleaning Austin - Fast Same-Day Service - Economy"         (57 chars) ✅
```

### Meta Descriptions  
- **Optimal:** 150-160 characters
- **Maximum:** 165 characters (mobile may show 120)
- **Required Elements:**
  - Primary service/benefit (first 120 chars - mobile cutoff)
  - Location mention (early, within first 100 chars)

"Drain cleaning in Austin & Marble Falls. Same-day hydro jetting, rooter service, camera inspection. Licensed plumbers. (512) 368-9159" (146 chars) ✅
```

## Water Heater Emphasis Strategy

**Distribution Goal:** 40% of pages should emphasize water heaters

### Pages REQUIRING Water Heater Emphasis:
1. ✅ Home page
2. ✅ Water heater service pages (all)
3. ✅ All service area pages
4. ✅ 40% of blog posts
5. ✅ "Plumber near me" landing page
6. ✅ Emergency plumbing page

### Water Heater Integration Patterns:

**Title Tags:**
```
Primary: "Water Heater Repair Austin & Marble Falls | Economy"
Secondary: "Emergency Plumber Austin | Water Heaters & Leaks | Economy"
Mention: "Plumbing Services Austin - Repairs, Water Heaters, Drains"
```

**Meta Descriptions:**
```
Lead with it: "Expert water heater repair in Austin. Same-day service..."
Include in list: "Full-service plumber: water heaters, leaks, drains..."
End mention: "...licensed plumbers for all repairs including water heaters."
```

### Balanced Approach (Don't Neglect Other Services):
```
✅ GOOD: "Water heater repair, drain cleaning & leak detection in Austin..."
❌ TOO NARROW: "Water heater specialists in Austin..." (neglects other services)

✅ GOOD: "Expert plumbers for water heaters, gas lines, sewer & drains in Austin..."  
❌ TOO BROAD: "Plumbing services in Austin..." (no specificity)
```
